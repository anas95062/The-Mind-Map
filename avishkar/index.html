            In computers, scrolling is the action of sliding text, images or video across a monitor or display,
            generally by using a scroll well. Scrolling does not change the layout of the text or pictures, 
            but incrementally moves the user's view across the screen. Smooth scrolling is a feature that 
            reduces what the viewer would perceive as jumps (discontinuous movement) in the display. When 
            this feature is applied to touchscreens, it is referred to as kinetic scrolling.
            Scrolling can be both horizontal and vertical. Vertical scrolling is the most common one, 
            normally, web browsers place as many words in a single line as will fit the width of the 
            browser window and when the text surpasses the screen size, vertical scrolling is 
            required to continue reading. Horizontal scrolling works well with portfolios and 
            gallery websites, but not so much with text-driven sites.
